# Semantic Image Segmentation
This is part of a dissertation project entitled <i>Semantic Image Segmentation and Image Understanding</i>. The thesis is focused on research over most segmentation techniques, including human perception theory and a review of the latest approaches in segmentation, based on ontologies. In addition, two implementation have been developed - brain tumor detection and road detection. Both are unsupervised methods, use low-level features and histogram thresholding.
<br />
## Brain tumor detection
The algorithm aims to retrieve brain tumors from MRI images. The method is adapted from [here](http://ijecscse.org/papers/apr2012/Brain-Tumour-Extraction-from-MRI-Images-Using-MATLAB.pdf), with additional information about Matlab implementation of morphological operations found in [this article](http://www.mecs-press.net/ijigsp/ijigsp-v4-n10/IJIGSP-V4-N10-5.pdf). 
<br />
The algorithm performs the following steps:
* convert the image to grayscale
* apply a noise reduction filter
* apply a gaussian low-pass filter
* apply a butterworth high-pass filter
* apply median filter
* perform histogram thresholding with single threshold (tumor/non-tumor)
* perform morphological operations with a parameter tuned according to image resolution, to avoid false positives:
  * create morfological, disk-shaped element
  * erode
  * dilate

<br />
The result is an image in which the tumor and non-tumor areas are colored differently.
